# Tracker

## Requirements
- Eigen
- freeGlut
- GLEW
- uEye
- Assimp
- Ceres
All the required libraries are included in the Common folder. For this reason the repository includes larger files as well, causing longer loading time but reducing deployment complexity.
If needed, these libraries can be replaced to their newer versions, but compalibility in that case is not guaranteed.

## Note
Build through MS Visual Studio in ***Release*** mode!
Hiperparameters can be tweaked in the config.ini file
Currently only supports 64bit Windows.
